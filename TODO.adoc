== ToDo

In case it's not obvious, the following is IN ADDITION to getting
the basic functionality working across all the designated APIs
that we need to demonstrate in the courses. It's more a placeholder
for IDEAS than an actual list of steps to do.

== Web UI

* Get a decent design

== Neat Functionality

* Digest an RSS feed of new movies, concerts, acts, and load into the database.
* "Sync Instance" feature to update the database from a master copy on the Internet.


== Cross-Platform

Use https://github.com/google/j2objc/[j2objc] to make iOS versions of at least the Model classes.
