== ToDo

== Basics

Need to have a different persistence.xml for main programs (under Eclipse) and for the web tier (under
the server), one using JDBC Params and the other using a DataSource.

== Beyond The Basics

The following is IN ADDITION to getting
the basic functionality working across all the designated APIs
that we need to demonstrate in the courses. It's more a placeholder
for IDEAS than an actual list of steps to do.

=== Web UI

* Get a decent design

=== Neat Functionality

* Digest an RSS feed of new movies, concerts, acts, and load into the database.
* "Sync Instance" feature to update the database from a master copy on the Internet.

=== Cross-Platform

Maybe use https://github.com/google/j2objc/[j2objc] to make iOS versions of at least the Model classes.
