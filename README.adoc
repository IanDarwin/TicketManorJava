= TicketManor

This is in the process of being updated for Java SE 11 and Java 8/Eclipse Jakarta.

This is a demo application of building enterprise applications using Java EE. There are 
a variety of APIs used, e.g., Java EE (JPA, EJB), Spring Framework, modern SPA Web (Angular, Ember.JS),
and so on. Each major framework has its own subdirectory.

It will be used as a showcase in various courses offered by http://learningtree.com/[Learning Tree],
the world leader in instructor-led tecnical training. Learning Tree offers courses in Java
as well as many other enterprise applications.

Legal Note: We do _not_ intend this to be a passing-off of TicketMaster.com, which is a trademark in
most countries. It is just a demonstration of how certain parts of an enterprise app could
be implemented. WE ARE NOT ACTUALLY SELLING ANY TICKETS.

This site is *not* affiliated in any way with http://ticketmaster.com/[TicketMaster(TM)] nor any
other commercial ticket selling organization.

== Building

The Java projects generally use Eclipse to write/compile/test code and Maven to build/package.
The Android project uses Android Studio (based on IntelliJ IDea) to write code
and Gradle to compile/test/package.

The top-level Maven pom runs each of the other projects (including android, through
a Maven plug-in that knows how to run Gradle). For some reason the top-level build
doesn't always succeed, so you might want to build just the EE project, as below.

== Deployment

The server projects are configured to deploy with the EE Server WildFly 8+

You MUST change the file ${WILDFLYHOME}/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml AND standalone-full.xml to have
a datasource named TicketManorDataSource.  For initial testing I just added:

	<datasource jndi-name="java:jboss/datasources/TicketManorDataSource" pool-name="TicketManorPool" 
		enabled="true" use-java-context="true">
		<connection-url>jdbc:h2:mem:ticketmanor;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE</connection-url>
		<driver>h2</driver>
		<security>
			<user-name>sa</user-name>
			<password>sa</password>
		</security>
	</datasource>

We should someday change this to a real database like PostgreSQL before deployment.

	cd ticketmanor-ee
	mvn wildfly:deploy # Assuming you have WildFly running

N.B. Never give the production app unfettered access to the database;
limit it by doing something like the following, which creates a new account
in the database accounting mechanism, separate from the database account that owns the database tables,
and gives it only insert and update privileges.
Commands are from PostgreSQL (where 'role' means 'user') but will be similar on other DB products.

----
postgres=# \c ticketmanor
You are now connected to database "ticketmanorjava"...

ticketmanor=# create role myAppAcct login password 'someEnchantedPasswordHere45678';
CREATE ROLE

ticketmanor=# revoke all on database ticketmanorjava from myAppAcct;
REVOKE

ticketmanor=# grant select, insert, update on all tables in schema public to myAppAcct;
GRANT
ticketmanor=# 
----

The "schema public" only applies to the current database, so it's important to connect
to the correct database before issuing this command!

You might need a few other perms if JPA/Hibernate is running in "create" or "update" mode,
but these modes should not really be used in production!

Note that when you want to delete a role that has been granted permissions, you must
first use _drop owned by myappacct cascade;_.

== Naming Conventions

In the Java code, classnames with:

* _Bean_ means either a JSF managed JavaBean or a Spring-managed JavaBean;
* _Resource_ means a RESTful web service endpoint;
* _Ejb_ (or *EJB) of course represents an Enterprise JavaBean.

== ToDos

=== Basics

Use http://www.stateofflow.com/journal/66/creating-java-projects-programmatically to create Eclipse
projects for different courses.

=== Beyond The Basics

The following is IN ADDITION to getting
the basic functionality working across all the designated APIs
that we need to demonstrate in the courses. It's more a placeholder
for IDEAS than an actual list of steps to do.

* "Sync Instance" feature to update the database from a master copy on the Internet.

=== Cross-Platformality

Maybe use https://github.com/google/j2objc/[j2objc] to make iOS versions of at least the Model classes.
