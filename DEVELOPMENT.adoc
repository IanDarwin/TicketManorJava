== Development Process

=== Java Team Members

If you are part of the Learning Tree Java/Android team, you should have access from your GitHub account.
If you are and you don't, please contact your Product Manager.

The current mode is "commit then review" (in the Apache sense), that is, you can make changes,
commit them, and push them to "master". If somebody objects to your code, we'll talk about it,
otherwise, your contribution is in. We each have designated areas to work on based on course
affiliation, so there shouldn't be much in the way of conflict (we hope!).

No need to squash commits (see "Squashed Commit is a Lie" on the interwebs).

=== Students and Others

If you are not part of this team, please fork the repository on github, make your changes,
and send a Pull Request. We will try to answer respond to these within a week, but we all have
other activities on the go. If you keep your coding style similar to ours, have tests for new
or changed code, and generally follow best practices, you have a better chance of getting your
contribution accepted.

=== Coding Style

Please use http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconventions-150003.pdf[the Sun/Oracle Java Coding Standards].

Use tabs, not spaces. One tab per indent. Break lines over 133 chars at a sensible place.
"+" or "." at the end of the line, not the beginning of the next line.

	final String MESSAGE = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit,\n" +
		"sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.";
	String result = someObject.getAnotherValue(MESSAGE).getResultList().
		get(currentIndex).toString();

Anything else, use your best judgement.

Thanks for being consistent!
